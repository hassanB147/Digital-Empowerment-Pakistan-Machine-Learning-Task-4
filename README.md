**Image Classification**

**Objective: Build a model to classify images into different categories.**

**Overview**

The goal of this project is to develop a deep learning model capable of classifying images into predefined categories using a labeled dataset. This project utilizes well-known datasets such as CIFAR-10 and MNIST to train a convolutional neural network (CNN), allowing for effective image recognition and classification tasks.


**Key Steps**

**Data Augmentation and Preprocessing:**


Perform data augmentation techniques to increase the diversity of the training dataset by applying transformations such as rotation, flipping, and scaling.

Normalize pixel values to a standard range (e.g., 0 to 1) to enhance model convergence.

Resize images to a consistent dimension to ensure uniformity across the dataset.

**Building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN):**

Construct a CNN architecture tailored for image classification, which includes convolutional layers for feature extraction, pooling layers for dimensionality reduction, and fully connected layers for classification.

Training the Model:

Utilize the training dataset to fit the CNN model, optimizing the weights through backpropagation and gradient descent.

Monitor the training process to ensure the model is learning effectively.

Model Evaluation and Fine-Tuning:

Evaluate the model's performance using a separate validation dataset to assess its classification accuracy and generalization capabilities.

Fine-tune the model by adjusting hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, batch size) and experimenting with different architectures to improve performance.

Handling Overfitting:

Implement techniques such as dropout (randomly setting a portion of neurons to zero during training) and regularization (adding a penalty for large weights) to prevent the model from overfitting the training data.
Results

The trained model will provide a classification accuracy metric, showcasing its ability to accurately categorize images. Further evaluation will include confusion matrices and precision-recall metrics to analyze the model's performance across different categories.
